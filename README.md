# 🐾 CatTinder – Find Your Favourite Kitty

CatTinder is a single-page web application built with React and JavaScript (powered by Vite) that lets users discover their preferred types of cats through swipe gestures — just like Tinder, but for felines! 🐱💕

This project was developed in response to a technical task by Netizen Experience.
